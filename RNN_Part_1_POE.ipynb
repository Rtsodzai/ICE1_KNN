        "A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed for processing sequential data (Jayawardhana, 2020;Research Graph,2024). Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs can take input data in a sequence and maintain a memory of previous inputs, which makes them particularly well-suited for tasks involving time-series data, natural language processing, and speech (Jayawardhana, 2020;Research Graph,2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "RNNs have \"memory,\" which allows them to carry information from one part of a sequence to another, effectively learning from the context of the entire sequence rather than just the individual input at each step (Donges, 2024). The ability to maintain information from previous steps in the sequence is the key feature which differenciates between RNNs and other neural networks (Donges, 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic structure of an RNN is a loop that allows information to be passed from one step to the next in a sequence. Each time the network processes an element of the sequence, it updates its hidden state (the memory of what it has seen so far) and outputs a prediction based on both the current input and its hidden state.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Input:** A sequence of data (e.g., words in a sentence, stock prices over time).\n",
        "* **Hidden State:** A set of values that capture the memory of the RNN from previous steps.\n",
        "* **Output:** The prediction or decision at each step in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common disadvantages of RNN**\n",
        "\n",
        "According to Donges,2024 below are some common challenges with RNNs which makes it difficult for basic RNNs to remember long-term dependencies in the data:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Vanishing gradients: During training, RNNs use backpropagation to update weights. However, as the sequence gets longer, the gradients (which indicate how much to update the weights) can become very small (vanish), making it difficult to learn long-term dependencies. This was solved through the concept of LSTM by Sepp Hochreiter and Juergen Schmidhuber.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Exploding gradients: Conversely, gradients can sometimes become too large, causing unstable weight updates and making the training process difficult.This problem can be easily solved by truncating or squashing the gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Complex training process: Because RNNs process data sequentially, this can result in a tedious training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Difficulty with long sequences: The longer the sequence, the harder RNNs must work to remember past information.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Inefficient methods: RNNs process data sequentially, which can be a slow and inefficient approach.  \n",
        "\n",
        "To address the issues with basic RNNs, especially the vanishing gradient problem, a more advanced type of RNN called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was developed. LSTMs are capable of learning long-term dependencies by using a more complex architecture that carefully regulates the flow of information."

        "1. **Sequential nature of textual data**\n",
        "\n",
        "The core reason for using RNN is that its a good fit for analyzing this dataset because of its sequential nature of textual data. When processing natural language (such as Twitter messages), the meaning of each word depends not only on the word itself but also on the surrounding words in the sentence. This means that the sentiment of the message regarding a given entity can only be understood by considering the order of the words and the context in which they appear.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Entity-Level Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset requires sentiment analysis at the entity level, meaning that the task is not just about understanding the general sentiment of a message but also the sentiment specifically about a given entity. For example, a tweet like:\n",
        "\n",
        "* \"Microsoft's new Windows OS is great, but their customer service is disappointing.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "* has both positive sentiment about \"Windows\" and negative sentiment about \"customer service.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "* RNNs, particularly LSTMs, can be trained to focus on the parts of the message that pertain to the entity being analyzed. The network processes each word in the sequence and can \"remember\" important aspects from earlier in the text that relate to the entity. This memory allows the model to correctly associate sentiment with the relevant entity, even when the sentence is long or contains multiple sentiments.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. **Contextual Understanding for Sentiment**\n",
        "\n",
        "In sentiment analysis, understanding context is crucial. Words or phrases can carry different sentiments depending on the context in which they are used. RNNs, and especially LSTMs, excel in contextual understanding because they can maintain information from earlier in the sentence and use it to interpret the meaning of words or phrases that appear later. This is critical for accurately determining the sentiment in the dataset, where different tweets may express sentiment in nuanced ways.\n",

        "6. **RNNs and Multiclass Classification**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this dataset, the task is to classify each tweet as either\n",
        "positive, negative, or neutral regarding a specific entity. RNNs, especially with LSTM layers, are powerful tools for multi-class classification tasks because they can learn to differentiate between subtle differences in text that correspond to each class."

After preprocessing the dataset, including tokenization and padding, the LSTM model was trained and validated with a focus on accuracy and generalization. The model achieved a commendable performance on the training set, with an accuracy of 88%, indicating that it effectively learned the patterns in the training data. The confusion matrix and classification report revealed that the model initially struggled with distinguishing certain sentiment classes, leading to suboptimal precision and recall for some categories.\n",

The validation results showed enhanced precision, recall, and F1-scores across all sentiment classes, demonstrating the model's robust ability to generalize to new, unseen data. This indicates that the model is well-calibrated and not overfitted, making it reliable for practical applications. Overall, the successful application of LSTM in this sentiment analysis task underscores its capability to effectively capture and interpret complex text data, providing valuable insights into sentiment classification for real-world use."
